# SearchGPT

SearchGPT is a tool-using agent that utilizes the power of GPT-3.5 to provide search-based responses to user queries. This project is based on the [How to build a tool-using agent with LangChain](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_build_a_tool-using_agent_with_Langchain.ipynb) example from the OpenAI Cookbook, with the addition of an interface using Gradio library.

## Usage

To start the SearchGPT interface, run the following command:

```sh
gradio searchgpt
```

This will launch the Gradio web interface for the SearchGPT chatbot.
